## Transferring large amount of data into AWS

### Over the internet / Site-to-Site VPN:
    Immediate to setup
    Will take 200(TB)*1000(GB)*1000(MB)*8(Mb)/100 Mbps = 16,000,000s = 185d

### Over direct connect 1Gbps:
    Long for the one-time setup (over a month)
    Will take 200(TB)*1000(GB)*8(Gb)/1 Gbps = 1,600,000s = 18.5d

### Over Snowball:
    Will take 2 to 3 snowballs in parallel
    Takes about 1 week for the end-to-end transfer
    Can be combined with DMS

### For on-going replication / transfers: Site-to-Site VPN or DX with DMS or DataSync
